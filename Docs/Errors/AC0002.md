# ``AM0002`` Unable to build map
This error indicates, that it is not possible to determine mapping automatically. So for example in the following situation:
```csharp
public class MyDependencyInjectedService : IMyDependencyInjectedService
{
    private readonly IConvertingService _convertingService;
    
    public MyDependencyInjectedService(IConvertingService convertingService)
    {
        _convertingService = convertingService;
    }

    public To ToTo(From someObject)
    {
        return _convertingService.Convert<From, To>(someObject);
    }
}

public record From
{
    public Guid FromId { get; init; }
}

public record To
{
    public Guid ToId { get; init; }
}
```

This error occures. You should be able to recognize which properties causing this problem from error description. If you can not adjust their names, use ``IConverter`` interface and define custom conversion for these types.
